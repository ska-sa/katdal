class SpectralWindow:
    """Spectral window specification.

    A spectral window is determined by the number of frequency channels produced
    by the correlator and their corresponding centre frequencies, as well as the
    channel width. The channels are assumed to be regularly spaced and to be the
    result of either lower-sideband downconversion (channel frequencies
    decreasing with channel index) or upper-sideband downconversion (frequencies
    increasing with index). For further information the receiver band and
    correlator product names are also available.

    .. warning::

        Instances should be treated as immutable. Changing the attributes will
        lead to inconsistencies between them.

    Parameters
    ----------
    centre_freq : float
        Centre frequency of spectral window, in Hz
    channel_width : float
        Bandwidth of each frequency channel, in Hz
    num_chans : int
        Number of frequency channels
    product : string, optional
        Name of data product / correlator mode
    sideband : {-1, +1}, optional
        Type of downconversion (-1 => lower sideband, +1 => upper sideband)
    band : {'L', 'UHF', 'S', 'X', 'Ku'}, optional
        Name of receiver / band
    bandwidth : float, optional
        The bandwidth of the whole spectral window, in Hz. If specified,
        `channel_width` is ignored and computed from the bandwidth. If not
        specified, bandwidth is computed from the channel width. Specifying
        this is a good idea if the channel width cannot be exactly represented
        in floating point.

    Attributes
    ----------
    channel_freqs : array of float, shape (*F*,)
        Centre frequency of each frequency channel (assuming LSB mixing), in Hz
