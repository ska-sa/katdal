def average_visibilities(vis, weight, flag, timestamps, channel_freqs, timeav=10, chanav=8, flagav=False):
    """Average visibilities, flags and weights.

    Visibilities are weight-averaged using the weights in the `weight` array
    with flagged data set to weight zero. The averaged weights are the sum of
    the input weights for each average block. An average flag is retained if
    all of the data in an averaging block is flagged (the averaged visibility
    in this case is the unweighted average of the input visibilities). In cases
    where the averaging size in channel or time does not evenly divide the size
    of the input data, the remaining channels or timestamps at the end of the
    array after averaging are discarded. Channels are averaged first and the
    timestamps are second. An array of timestamps and frequencies corresponding
    to each channel is also directly averaged and returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vis: array(numtimestamps,numchannels,numbaselines) of complex64.
          The input visibilities to be averaged.
    weight: array(numtimestamps,numchannels,numbaselines) of float32.
          The input weights (used for weighted averaging).
    flag: array(numtimestamps,numchannels,numbaselines) of boolean.
          Input flags (flagged data have weight zero before averaging).
    timestamps: array(numtimestamps) of int.
          The timestamps (in mjd seconds) corresponding to the input data.
    channel_freqs: array(numchannels) of int.
          The frequencies (in Hz) corresponding to the input channels.
    timeav: int.
          The desired averaging size in timestamps.
    chanav: int.
          The desired averaging size in channels.
    flagav: bool
          Flagged averaged data in when there is a single flag in the bin if true.
          Only flag averaged data when all data in the bin is flagged if false.

    Returns
    -------
    av_vis: array(int(numtimestamps/timeav),int(numchannels/chanav)) of complex64.
    av_weight: array(int(numtimestamps/timeav),int(numchannels/chanav)) of float32.
    av_flag: array(int(numtimestamps/timeav),int(numchannels/chanav)) of boolean.
    av_mjd: array(int(numtimestamps/timeav)) of int.
    av_freq: array(int(numchannels)/chanav) of int.
