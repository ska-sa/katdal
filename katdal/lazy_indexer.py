class LazyIndexer:
    """Two-stage deferred indexer for objects with expensive __getitem__ calls.

    This class was originally designed to extend and speed up the indexing
    functionality of HDF5 datasets as found in :mod:`h5py`, but works on any
    equivalent object (defined as any object with `shape`, `dtype` and
    `__getitem__` members) where a call to __getitem__ may be very expensive.
    The following discussion focuses on the HDF5 use case as the main example.

    Direct extraction of a subset of an HDF5 dataset via the __getitem__
    interface (i.e. `dataset[index]`) has a few issues:

    1. Data access can be very slow (or impossible) if a very large dataset is
       fully loaded into memory and then indexed again at a later stage
    2. Advanced indexing (via boolean masks or sequences of integer indices) is
       only supported on a single dimension in the current version of h5py (2.0)
    3. Even though advanced indexing has limited support, simple indexing (via
       single integer indices or slices) is frequently much faster.

    This class wraps an :class:`h5py.Dataset` or equivalent object and exposes a
    new __getitem__ interface on it. It efficiently composes two stages of
    indexing: a first stage specified at object instantiation time and a second
    stage that applies on top of the first stage when __getitem__ is called on
    this object. The data are only loaded after the combined index is determined,
    addressing issue 1.

    Furthermore, advanced indexing is allowed on any dimension by decomposing
    the selection as a series of slice selections covering contiguous segments
    of the dimension to alleviate issue 2. Finally, this also allows faster
    data retrieval by extracting a large slice from the HDF5 dataset and then
    performing advanced indexing on the resulting :class:`numpy.ndarray` object
    instead, in response to issue 3.

    The `keep` parameter of the :meth:`__init__` and :meth:`__getitem__` methods
    accepts a generic index or slice specification, i.e. anything that would be
    accepted by the :meth:`__getitem__` method of a :class:`numpy.ndarray` of
    the same shape as the dataset. This could be a single integer index, a
    sequence of integer indices, a slice object (representing the colon operator
    commonly used with __getitem__, e.g. representing `x[1:10:2]` as
    `x[slice(1,10,2)]`), a sequence of booleans as a mask, or a tuple containing
    any number of these (typically one index item per dataset dimension). Any
    missing dimensions will be fully selected, and any extra dimensions will
    be ignored.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : :class:`h5py.Dataset` object or equivalent
        Underlying dataset or array object on which lazy indexing will be done.
        This can be any object with shape, dtype and __getitem__ members.
    keep : NumPy index expression, optional
        First-stage index as a valid index or slice specification
        (supports arbitrary slicing or advanced indexing on any dimension)
    transforms : list of :class:`LazyTransform` objects or None, optional
        Chain of transforms to be applied to data after final indexing. The
        chain as a whole may only add or drop dimensions at the end of data
        shape without changing the preserved dimensions.

    ----------
    name : string
        Name of HDF5 dataset (or empty string for unnamed ndarrays, etc.)

    Raises
    ------
    InvalidTransform

class DaskLazyIndexer:
    """Turn a dask Array into a LazyIndexer by computing it upon indexing.

    The LazyIndexer wraps an underlying `dataset` in the form of a dask Array.
    Upon first use, it applies a stored first-stage selection (`keep`) to the
    array, followed by a series of `transforms`. All of these actions are lazy
    and only update the dask graph of the `dataset`. Since these updates are
    computed only on first use, there is minimal cost in constructing an
    instance and immediately throwing it away again.

    Second-stage selection occurs via a :meth:`__getitem__` call on this
    object, which also triggers dask computation to return the final
    :class:`numpy.ndarray` output. Both selection steps follow outer indexing
    ("oindex") semantics, by indexing each dimension / axis separately.

    DaskLazyIndexers can also index other DaskLazyIndexers, which allows them
    to share first-stage selections and/or transforms, and to construct nested
    or hierarchical indexers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dataset : :class:`dask.Array` or :class:`DaskLazyIndexer`
        The full dataset, from which a subset is chosen by `keep`
    keep : NumPy index expression, optional
        Index expression describing first-stage selection (e.g. as applied by
        :meth:`katdal.DataSet.select`), with oindex semantics
    transforms : sequence of function, signature ``array = f(array)``, optional
        Transformations that are applied after indexing by `keep` but
        before indexing on this object. Each transformation is a callable
        that takes a dask array and returns another dask array.

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        The name of the (full) underlying dataset, useful for reporting
    dataset : :class:`dask.Array`
        The dask array that is accessed by indexing (after applying `keep` and
        `transforms`). It can be used directly to perform dask computations.

        This applies the given second-stage index on top of the current

        applied to it. The indexer also finally stops being lazy and triggers
        dask computation to arrive at the output array.

        Both indexing stages perform "outer" indexing (aka oindex), which
        indexes each dimension independently. This is especially relevant for
